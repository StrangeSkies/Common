/**
 * A class definition is a description of a class implementation. It may extend
 * an existing class, and implement existing interfaces, as well as provide
 * {@link MethodDefinition method implementations} and overrides for those
 * supertypes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A class definition may be implemented reflectively via {@link Proxy},
 * delegating invocations to direct evaluation of {@link MethodDefinition method
 * definition bodies}, and the{@link Statement statements} therein. A class
 * definition also contains enough information to generate the bytecode for a
 * true implementation, with performance comparable to a regular compiled Java
 * class, though this is not yet implemented.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Aside from this than this, there are currently a number of significant
 * limitations to class definitions:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Though supertypes may be parameterized generic types, it is not supported
 * for the class definition itself to be a generic type.</li>
 * 
 * <li>It is not supported to declare new methods which are not simply overrides
 * of existing methods. Variance is technically supported where appropriate in
 * method declarations, but the information is not available reflectively so
 * this provides limited utility.</li>
 * 
 * <li>It is possible to define an implementation for a default constructor if
 * necessary, but it is not supported to define constructors with
 * arguments.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * These limitations help to keep class definitions simple, as their type can be
 * effectively reflected over via {@link TypeToken} with no special
 * consideration. Also the need for interdependencies between class definitions
 * should be largely avoided.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are a few potential paths to evolving this class beyond some or all of
 * these limitations ... But they are likely to require significant work, and
 * may challenge some pervasive assumptions made by the existing library design,
 * for example that the raw type of any type is a {@link Class}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Every implementation generated via a class definition also be cast to
 * {@link Reified} to reflect over its exact type. The implementation of all
 * relevant methods will be generated automatically <em>where possible</em>. If
 * the {@link Reified} class is overridden explicitly however, or if any method
 * in {@link Reified} is shadowed by an explicitly overridden class, the user
 * should provide their own implementations for these methods.
 * 
 * Note that if supported is added for generation of generic classes in the
 * future, the exact type of such classes may not be determined statically so
 * they will not implement reified by default.
