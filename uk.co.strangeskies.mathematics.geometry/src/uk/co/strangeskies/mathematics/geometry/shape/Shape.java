/**
 * TODO: Decide whether the following decision is sensible! Maybe we should
 * require all shapes be affinely transformable? Would be okay for polygons,
 * ellipses, and beziers. Maybe we should use homogeneous coordinates after all?
 * 
 * Also TODO, think about passing in triangulator to polygon builder and have
 * shapes triangulate internally. This would help in cases where triangulation
 * is necessary for calculation of other properties, so as not to have to
 * recalculate it...
 * 
 * In general, classes and interfaces which extend Shape should deal with
 * <em>non-homogeneous</em> vectors, in the interests of a simple and consistent
 * API. Shapes don't generally support affine transformations or related
 * operations, so there is little value in trying to make homogeneous coordinate
 * space a consistent part of the API at this level. Classes related to
 * {@link Mesh}, on the other hand, do deal with homogeneous coordinate space.
