/**
 * A simple text parser, composable by way of fluid and type-safe API. This
 * class is intended for fairly simple use-cases.
 * <p>
 * Usage should be intuitive enough for users familiar with context free
 * grammars, where a {@link Parser} instance represents a single symbol, and all
 * production rules on that symbol. {@link Parser} instances should be
 * immutable.
 * <p>
 * By this interpretation, production rules for new symbols can be derived by
 * appending and prepending text, or other symbols, to existing symbols.
 * Multiple production rules can effectively be created for a new symbol by
 * "piping" production rules through {@link #orElse(Parser)} and
 * {@link #orElse(Supplier)}.
 * <p>
 * For the sake of simplicity, all parsers are composed and evaluated greedily
 * from left to right, unless otherwise noted.
 * <p>
 * Parsing is one way. Composition should be dealt with by other means, as it is
 * expected to be a far simpler process in itself but support would add a
 * significant amount of complexity to this API.
