/**
 * A collections which can be observed for changes. The collection is
 * {@link Observable} over itself, i.e. events will be triggered with the event
 * object being the collection itself. There is also an observable interface
 * {@link #changes()} over a type {@code C} which is parameterisable by
 * subtypes, and which may contain further information about the nature of the
 * change.
 * <p>
 * Observable events should be triggered each time the collection is changed.
 * Many small internal sub-changes may be grouped into a single conceptual
 * change, and so only trigger once upon completion. The ordering of sub-changes
 * is generally considered an implementation detail in this case, and may not be
 * made available via the change event message type {@code C}.
 * <p>
 * Event messages may only be valid during the invocation of the
 * {@link Consumer#accept(Object)} method on observers, so references should
 * typically not be held beyond this point.
