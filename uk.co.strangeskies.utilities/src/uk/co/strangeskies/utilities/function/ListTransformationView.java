/**
 * A view of a list which will be automatically updated along with the original,
 * but who's elements will be a transformation of the original associated
 * elements by way of the function passed to the constructor. The implementation
 * employs lazy evaluation, so try to use get() as little as possible by reusing
 * the result.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike the {@link Stream#map(Function)} function, which can provide similar
 * functionality in certain circumstances, this class provides a view which is
 * reusable and backed by the original collection, such that it will reflect
 * changes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the constructor is supplied with an {@link InvertibleFunction}, it will be
 * possible to add elements to this collection.
