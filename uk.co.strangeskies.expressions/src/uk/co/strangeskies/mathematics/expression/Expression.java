/**
 * <p>
 * An expression for use in reactive programming. An expression has a
 * <em>value</em> which can be <em>resolved</em> through the invocation of
 * {@link #getValue()} or {@link #decoupleValue()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be {@link Observable} over a specific behavior: its
 * {@link Observer}s should be notified any time the value which would be
 * resolved from the expression becomes different from the previously-resolved,
 * last-known value.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any mechanism of synchronization, though a common concern, is left entirely
 * to the discretion of implementations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that the concept of an {@link Expression} differs from the concept of a
 * {@link ObservableValue} in that an expression is observable over itself,
 * rather than being observable over the value it represents. This is because
 * expressions are more typically intended to be lazily evaluated, and observers
 * directly over the value would cause eager evaluation. The methods
 * {@link #over(ObservableValue)} and {@link #over(Observable, Object)} are
 * provided to bridge the gap from {@link Observable} to {@link Expression}.

	 * class, a const reference, or a copy of the underlying value. This is
	 * important, but conversely it does <em>not</em> mean that the return value
	 * can necessarily be relied upon not to not mutate when this expression is
	 * updated, unless a read lock is held.

	 * Once a value has been returned, it is up to the implementing Expression as

	 * even if the conceptual value of this expression subsequently changes, or
	 * whether it will update automatically with the expression. Please only rely
	 * on either behavior if it is explicitly documented, otherwise use
	 * {@link #decoupleValue()} if you need a persistent reference which is safe
	 * <em>to</em> mutate and/or safe <em>from</em> external mutation.

	 * The observers should only ever be notified of an update from the thread
	 * which has the write lock on an {@link Expression}, and {@link Expression}s
