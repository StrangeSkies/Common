Bundle-Name: Strange Skies :: Expressions
Bundle-Description: \
	A set of reactive programming utilities for Java, built around the concept \
	of mutable (and immutable) 'expressions', which may be self contained, or \
	lazily-evaluated over a number of dependency expressions. The design attempts \
	to prioritise performance and thread safety.
